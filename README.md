Basic 'LifeInvader' script for FiveM

Add `ensure LifeInvader` (or whatever you name the folder containing these 2 files) into your **server.cfg** file.
Do not edit, copy or redistribute this script without my permission.

Isn't made for sparkles and shines, it's very basic, but works fine.

Comes with a Config
`DiscordLogging` (BOOL)
`DiscordWebook` (STRING) If DiscordLogging is enabled.
`ChatResourceName` (STRING) What the resource will call itself in chat.

This is how it will show on discord:
- App Title: Player's in-game name (By steam or settings)
- Message: Player's in-game handle (What they set) and their Server ID, and their message
